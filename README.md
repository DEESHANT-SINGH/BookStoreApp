<h1>Project = BookStoreApp</h1>

<p>The program that allows the user to store information about books.</p>
<p>I have also build a executable file of this program i.e. (.exe) apart from building a .py file that we can run on windows.(you can see .exe file in "BookStore Application exe file" folder)</p>
<p>So, what is the advantage of this .exe file is that you can give this program to anyone and they don't need to have python installed in their computer. </p>

<p><b>NOTE=</b>You just have to install BookStore App.exe in your computer and that books.db will automatically be generated once you open the .exe file by double clicking.</p>

<b>Build using =</b> Python, tkinter, SQLite 3 library which is used to interact with SQLite database.
